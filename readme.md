Here is the coding challenge

The at-home coding exercise is simply this: read data from a publicly available REST api, and display the results on a web page.

 

You can use any javascript framework you feel comfortable with (not typescript).

 

The Rest API I picked is documented here (this is just one I found online  (I’m told it may now require registering to use):

The particular endpoint will be the “Company Profile” one.

 

The requirements are pretty generic on purpose, to give you some room to work within (Do not feel limited by them)..

 

1) As a user, I want to be able to provide the stock symbol of any company, so that I can retrieve and view all of that company’s profile information

     - Given that the company data for “changes” or “changesPercentage” are positive, when displayed the field should be green

- Given that the company data for “changes” or “changesPercentage” are negative, when displayed the field should be red

- Given that the price field has data, it should be displayed with the $ sign

     - Given that the “website” field has a link, when I click on it, it should take me to the website
